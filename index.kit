      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I'm a digital strategist and designer who works with brands and design teams to help think, strategize and design frameworks that grow as design trends and consumerâ€™s expectations evolve.</p>
      <p>I believe that content is king and any idea can be implemented into a compelling and value-driving experience. Over the last 15+ years, I have helped build a design studio from scratch, worked with startups small and large, and tackle challenges with Atlassian, Immutable, Sprint, PepsiCo, Gatorade, Electrolux/Frigidaire, and Ford Motor Company to understand business needs and user-valued solutions.</p>
      <p>During that time, I have watched the digital landscape grow up from ma &amp; pop marketing websites, to full-fledged digital products and services that supports business workflow and provides consumers value. I hold a BFA, emphasis in visual communications, from Kansas State University and currently leading design teams for <a href="https://jira.com">Jira</a>, previously Ecosystem and Forge platform teams at Atlassian.</p>
